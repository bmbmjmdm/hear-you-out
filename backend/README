## deploying

probably only want to deploy what's on the prod branch. so that there is a log of the exact code that was publicly running.

so assuming that branch is ready to go: prod-deploy.sh:
```
git stash
git checkout prod
deta deploy
deta cron set "10 minutes"
git unstash

```

### deploying to prod

`deta deploy` iirc
`deta cron set "10 minutes"`

not sure if i need to reset the cron like that but i assume it's idempotent

### deploying to dev

we have a 2nd project (with different set of main+test DBs) for the dev instance. we can always keep auth enabled for this so it is not publicly accessible.

github action to deploy pushes to dev branch to this project+micro.

## question rotation

the cronjob is defined in main.py:

the cronjob run every 10 min and is responsible for :
- checking whether it is time to rotate the active question. it does this by
  - first calculating how many hours the question has been active for (by comparing the current datetime (in utc) to the 'asked_on' date of the question in the questions database).
  - it then compares this value (how long it has been active for) with the configuration variable hours_between_questions. if the former is larger, it is time to rotate the active question.

rotate the active question:
- scan the questions_list.yaml for the first question in order that isn't yet in DB
- unset the flag on the current active question
- insert and set the flag on the new active question 
- post-process the data belonging to that question from the drive

so getQuestion just checks the new active_question table for the uuid, then grabs that question content from the questions table

test the cronjob function by staging test db and calling it directly

## misc

TODO should clarify in READMe that to change duration of active question, need to edit it's row in the db. but to change duration of future questions, change it in the yaml
