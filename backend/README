# Instructions to run the backend
1. Move up to main directory
2. docker compose up
Congrats, you're running the backend!

# Creating first admin:
In /api/admin/create_admin provide ADMIN_SECRET as password. Care, as only one admin can be created that way.

# Autopopulating database
0. (?) Nuke your current database - required if you lost admin access
1. From /backend run: "python -m db_mockup.autopopulate"
