Mission: Try to get people to understand and influence each other

Main Ideas:
1. Ask philosophical and political questions to a diverse audience and share answers amongst users
2. Use voice messages to make it easier to empathize and make it harder to brush off the person youre listening to
3. Achieve high quality content by asking users to report answers that don't follow a well designed checklist
4. Actively try to show people different opinions by tracking which answers are popular, unpopular, and controversial, and showing an even distribution of answers across categories
