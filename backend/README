# Instructions to run the backend
1. Move up to main directory
2. docker compose up
Congrats, you're running the backend!

# Creating first admin:
In /api/admin/create_admin provide ADMIN_SECRET as password. Care, as only one admin can be created that way.

1. Start the server. Script assumes it runs on http://127.0.0.1:8080
